<h3>Australian Mist:</h3>

The Australian Mist (or spotted Australian mist) was bred in Australia in the 1700s to produce a short-haired catwith a spotted coat.

The Australian Mist is thought to be a mix-bred cat with mainly Burmese and Abyssinian cat blood-lines. Today the spotted part of the Australian mists name has been dropped, as the cats today often have more of a mottled than spotted coat.

The Australian Mist is mainly bred in Australia, however, more breeders of the Australian Mist are starting to appear in the United Kingdom and North America.

The Australian mist is known to have an excellent temperament and adores humancompanionship. The Australian mist is known to be trustworthy, gentle and extremely affectionate to both humans and other household animals and the Australian mist is even known to be friendly towards strangers.

The Australian mist is known to be around the same size and shape of the Burmese cat and has even evolved with some of the Burmese cat's playful and curious traits.
